# Podcast Analytics & Sponsorship Platform

**Turn your podcast into a revenue-generating machine with enterprise-grade analytics, automated sponsor matching, and real-time attribution tracking.**

---

## What This Is

A complete, production-ready platform that solves the hardest problems in podcast monetization. We've built everything you need to track listener behavior, match with sponsors, measure campaign performance, and prove ROI—all in one unified system.

Most podcasters are flying blind. They don't know who's listening, when campaigns actually convert, or how to price their inventory. This platform fixes that. It's the infrastructure that turns podcasts into measurable, scalable businesses.

---

## Why This Exists

Podcast monetization is broken. Here's what's wrong:

- **No visibility**: You can't see who's listening, where they're coming from, or what drives conversions
- **Manual matching**: Finding sponsors is a time-consuming, relationship-dependent process
- **Attribution chaos**: Proving ROI means cobbling together data from multiple sources, and it's still guesswork
- **Pricing blind spots**: You're either leaving money on the table or pricing yourself out of deals

We built this because we needed it. After running podcast operations at scale, we realized the tools don't exist. So we built them.

## What You Get

### 📊 **Real-Time Analytics That Actually Matter**

Track listener behavior, episode performance, and audience demographics. Not just downloads—actual insights that help you make decisions. See which episodes drive engagement, which topics resonate, and how your audience grows over time.

### 🎯 **Intelligent Sponsor Matching**

Stop cold-emailing sponsors. Our AI-powered matching engine analyzes advertiser needs against podcast content, audience, and performance data to surface perfect-fit opportunities automatically.

### 💰 **Attribution That Proves ROI**

Multiple attribution models (first-touch, last-touch, linear, time-decay, position-based) let you show sponsors exactly how campaigns perform. Cross-platform tracking connects podcast listens to website visits, purchases, and conversions.

### 📈 **Automated Campaign Management**

From insertion orders to performance reports, automate the entire campaign lifecycle. Set up automated workflows that create IOs when deals close, recalculate matches when data changes, and generate reports on schedule.

### 🔒 **Enterprise-Grade Security & Multi-Tenancy**

Built for agencies, networks, and platforms that manage multiple podcasts. Tenant isolation, role-based access control, and comprehensive audit logs ensure data security and compliance.

### 🤖 **AI-Powered Insights**

Content analysis, anomaly detection, and predictive analytics help you understand what's working and what's not. Get recommendations on episode topics, optimal ad placement, and audience growth strategies.

---

## Real-World Use Cases

**Solo Podcaster**: Track which episodes drive the most engagement, prove value to sponsors with attribution data, and automate campaign reporting so you can focus on creating content.

**Podcast Network**: Manage dozens of shows, match advertisers across your entire inventory, and provide unified reporting to sponsors while maintaining show-level autonomy.

**Agency**: Onboard new podcast clients quickly, demonstrate ROI with cross-platform attribution, and scale operations without hiring more account managers.

**Enterprise Platform**: White-label the entire platform, offer it to your podcast creators, and monetize through revenue sharing while maintaining full control over the experience.

**Advertiser**: Find podcasts that match your target audience, track campaign performance across multiple shows, and optimize spend based on real attribution data.

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.11+
- PostgreSQL 15+ (with TimescaleDB extension for time-series data)
- Redis 7+
- Node.js 20+ (for frontend)
- PostgreSQL client tools (`psql`) for migrations

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/podcast-analytics-platform.git
cd podcast-analytics-platform

# Install Python dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Set up environment variables
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your configuration (see Database Setup below)

# Start local database (using Docker Compose)
docker-compose up -d postgres redis

# Run database migrations
./scripts/db-migrate-local.sh

# Start the backend API
uvicorn src.main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000

# In another terminal, start the frontend
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

### Database Setup

#### Local Development

1. **Start PostgreSQL with TimescaleDB**:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d postgres
   ```

2. **Apply migrations**:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/db-migrate-local.sh
   ```

   Or manually:
   ```bash
   psql postgresql://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/podcast_analytics \
     -f db/migrations/99999999999999_master_schema.sql
   ```

#### Production / Hosted Database

**Recommended: Supabase** (see `docs/backend-options-and-costs.md` for analysis)

1. **Get connection string** from your database provider
2. **Set environment variable**:
   ```bash
   export DATABASE_URL="postgresql://user:password@host:5432/database"
   ```
3. **Apply migration**:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/db-migrate-hosted.sh
   ```

**Important**: Always create a backup before applying migrations to production!

For detailed migration instructions, see [`docs/migrations-workflow.md`](docs/migrations-workflow.md).

#### Environment Variables

Configure database connection in `.env`:

```bash
# Option 1: Use DATABASE_URL (recommended)
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@host:5432/database

# Option 2: Use individual variables (for backward compatibility)
POSTGRES_HOST=localhost
POSTGRES_PORT=5432
POSTGRES_DATABASE=podcast_analytics
POSTGRES_USER=postgres
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=postgres
```

See [`.env.example`](.env.example) for all available configuration options.

### Your First 10 Minutes

1. **Start the services**: Follow the installation steps above
2. **Create a tenant**: `POST /api/v1/tenants` with your organization details
3. **Add a podcast**: `POST /api/v1/podcasts` with your RSS feed URL
4. **View analytics**: Navigate to `/dashboard` to see listener metrics
5. **Set up attribution**: Configure tracking URLs for your campaigns

## Key Features in Detail

### Multi-Tenant Architecture
Every organization gets isolated data, custom branding, and independent configuration. Perfect for agencies managing multiple clients or platforms offering white-label solutions.

### Advanced Attribution Models
Choose the attribution model that fits your needs:
- **First Touch**: Credit the first interaction
- **Last Touch**: Credit the final interaction before conversion
- **Linear**: Distribute credit evenly across all touchpoints
- **Time Decay**: Give more credit to recent interactions
- **Position Based**: Weight first and last touchpoints more heavily

### Automated Workflows
Define workflows that trigger on events. Examples:
- Auto-create insertion orders when deals reach "won" stage
- Recalculate matches when advertiser or podcast data changes
- Generate and email reports on a schedule
- Send alerts when campaigns underperform

### Cost Tracking & Optimization
Track resource usage and costs per tenant. Monitor API calls, database queries, storage, and compute. Set budgets and get alerts when thresholds are exceeded.

### Security & Compliance
- OAuth2 authentication with JWT tokens
- Multi-factor authentication (MFA)
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Attribute-based access control (ABAC)
- API key management
- Comprehensive audit logs
