## 1-Sentence Description

**Podcast Analytics & Sponsorship Platform** - We turn podcasts into revenue-generating machines by providing enterprise-grade analytics, automated sponsor matching, and attribution tracking that proves ROI to sponsors.

---

## 30-Second Explanation

Podcasters are flying blind. They can't prove ROI to sponsors, so they leave money on the table. We built the infrastructure that tracks listener behavior, matches sponsors automatically, and measures campaign performance with real attribution—not guesswork. Think "Stripe for podcast monetization"—we make it measurable and scalable.

## 2-Minute Explanation

**The Problem:**  
Podcast monetization is broken. Most podcasters don't know who's listening, can't prove campaign ROI, and spend hours manually creating reports. Sponsors can't trust attribution data (promo codes are unreliable), so they underinvest in podcast advertising.

**The Solution:**  
We built a unified platform that solves the hardest problems in podcast monetization:

1. **Real-Time Analytics:** Track listener behavior, episode performance, and audience demographics—not just downloads, but actual insights that drive decisions.

2. **Intelligent Sponsor Matching:** AI-powered engine analyzes advertiser needs against podcast content, audience, and performance to surface perfect-fit opportunities automatically.

3. **Attribution That Proves ROI:** Multiple attribution models (first-touch, last-touch, linear, time-decay, position-based) with cross-platform tracking connecting podcast listens to website visits, purchases, and conversions.

4. **Automated Campaign Management:** From insertion orders to performance reports, automate the entire campaign lifecycle with workflows that create IOs when deals close and generate reports on schedule.

**Who Needs This:**  
- Solo podcasters (1K-50K downloads) who need to prove value to sponsors
- Producers/agencies managing multiple shows who need portfolio-level insights
- Brands/sponsors who need ROI proof for podcast advertising spend

**What's New/Different:**  
- **First platform** to combine analytics, sponsor matching, and attribution in one system
- **Cross-platform attribution** that actually works (connects podcast → website → purchase)
- **AI-powered matching** that replaces manual cold-emailing
- **Multi-tenant architecture** built for agencies and networks from day one

**How It Works End-to-End (Solo Podcaster Example):**

1. **Onboarding:** Podcaster connects RSS feed → system ingests episodes automatically
2. **Campaign Creation:** Podcaster creates campaign, sets up attribution (promo code or pixel)
3. **Campaign Launch:** Ad runs in episode → system tracks downloads, streams, listener behavior
4. **Attribution Tracking:** System tracks conversions (promo code redemptions, website visits, purchases)
5. **ROI Calculation:** System calculates ROI automatically using multiple attribution models
6. **Report Generation:** Podcaster generates sponsor-ready PDF report in <30 seconds
7. **Renewal:** Podcaster uses renewal insights to justify rate increases → sponsor renews at higher rate

**Before/After Story:**

**Before (Without Product):**
- Podcaster spends 2+ hours manually creating sponsor reports
- Can't prove ROI → sponsors don't renew or offer lower rates
- No visibility into which episodes drive engagement
- Attribution is guesswork (promo codes only, unreliable)
- Can't compare performance across campaigns
- Time spent on admin instead of creating content

**After (With Product):**
- Generate sponsor reports in <30 seconds
- Prove ROI with real attribution data → 25%+ higher renewal rates
- See which episodes drive engagement → optimize content strategy
- Accurate attribution across multiple touchpoints → sponsors trust the data
- Compare campaigns side-by-side → optimize budget allocation
- Automate campaign management → focus on creating content

## Key Differentiators

1. **Only platform** that combines analytics, sponsor matching, and attribution in one system
2. **Cross-platform attribution** that actually works (not just promo codes)
3. **AI-powered matching** replaces manual sponsor discovery
4. **Multi-tenant architecture** built for agencies/networks from day one
5. **Enterprise-grade** security, compliance, and scalability

## Technical Edge

- **Time-series database** (TimescaleDB) optimized for analytics at scale
- **Multiple attribution models** with configurable windows
- **AI framework** for content analysis and predictive analytics
- **Workflow engine** for intelligent automation
- **Multi-tenant isolation** with RBAC and audit logs
