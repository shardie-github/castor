## Validated Learnings

### LEARN-001: Problem Is Well-Documented

**Date:** [Date]
**Hypothesis:** HYP-001 - Problem Exists and Is Urgent
**Test:** User research, market research
**Result:** User personas document pain points, Jobs-to-Be-Done framework validates problem

**Learning:**
- Problem is widespread (300K+ solo podcasters)
- Manual reporting takes 2+ hours per campaign
- Attribution is guesswork (promo codes unreliable)
- Sponsors don't trust data

**Decision:** Persevere (problem validated through research, need customer validation)

**Next Steps:**
- Conduct 10-20 user interviews
- Get early customer validation

---

### LEARN-002: Market Size Is Significant

**Date:** [Date]
**Hypothesis:** HYP-002 - Problem Is Widespread
**Test:** Market sizing analysis
**Result:** TAM ~$550M+, SAM ~$11M ARR, SOM ~$2.55M ARR

**Learning:**
- Large addressable market (300K+ solo podcasters)
- Significant revenue opportunity ($2.55M+ ARR conservative)
- Market timing is right (podcast industry maturing)

**Decision:** Persevere (market size validated, need customer validation)

**Next Steps:**
- Validate market with user interviews
- Get early customer traction

---

### LEARN-003: Metrics Infrastructure Enables Growth

**Date:** [Date]
**Hypothesis:** HYP-015 - Metrics Infrastructure Enables Growth
**Test:** Built metrics infrastructure
**Result:** Metrics infrastructure built and working

**Learning:**
- Metrics infrastructure is critical for growth
- Data-driven decisions enable optimization
- Tracking enables rapid iteration

**Decision:** Persevere (infrastructure built, enables growth)

**Next Steps:**
- Use metrics to track growth experiments
- Optimize based on metrics
