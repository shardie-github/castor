## Notes

- All documents marked with `> TODO: Founders to supply real data` need real data before YC application/interview
- Documents are living documents - update as you learn more, get traction, or make changes
- Cross-reference documents for consistency (e.g., metrics in `YC_PRODUCT_OVERVIEW.md` should match `YC_METRICS_CHECKLIST.md`)
