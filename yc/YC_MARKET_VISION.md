**Why Now:**
- Podcast industry maturing (2M+ podcasts globally)

- Attribution tools improving (pixels, UTM tracking)

**Entry Strategy:**
- **Freemium model:** Free tier to acquire users (1 podcast, basic analytics)
- **Value demonstration:** Generate first report in <30 seconds → immediate value
- **Upsell triggers:** Usage-based (3+ reports, 2+ campaigns) → Starter tier ($29/mo)
