# Hypothesis Testing Framework

**For:** Lean Startup Lens, Build-Measure-Learn  
**Last Updated:** 2024

---

## Framework Overview

**Process:** Hypothesis → Test → Result → Learn → Persevere/Pivot

**Steps:**
1. **Define Hypothesis:** If X, then Y, because Z
2. **Design Test:** How to test, what metrics, success criteria
3. **Run Test:** Execute test, collect data
4. **Analyze Results:** Did hypothesis validate or invalidate?
5. **Learn & Decide:** What did we learn? Persevere or pivot?

## Hypothesis Template

### Hypothesis Definition
- **Hypothesis ID:** [HYP-XXX]
- **Hypothesis:** [If X, then Y, because Z]
- **Type:** [Problem/Customer/Feature/Revenue/Growth]
- **Status:** [Untested/Testing/Validated/Invalidated]

### Test Design
- **Test Method:** [How to test]
- **Metrics:** [What metrics to measure]
- **Success Criteria:** [What's success?]
- **Timeline:** [How long to test?]

### Test Execution
- **Launch Date:** [Date]
- **End Date:** [Date]
- **Data Collected:** [What data was collected]

### Results Analysis
- **Result:** [Test result]
- **Did Hypothesis Validate?** [Yes/No/Partially]
- **Key Learnings:** [What did we learn?]

### Decision
- **Decision:** [Persevere/Pivot/Kill]
- **Reasoning:** [Why this decision]
- **Next Steps:** [What's next?]

## Testing Methods

### User Interviews
**When to Use:** Problem validation, customer segment validation
**How:** Conduct 10-20 interviews with target users
**Metrics:** Problem confirmation rate, pain point frequency
**Success Criteria:** 80%+ confirm problem, top 3 pain points identified

### Early Customer Traction
**When to Use:** Solution validation, willingness to pay
**How:** Launch to early customers, track signups and conversions
**Metrics:** Signups, activation rate, conversion rate, MRR
**Success Criteria:** 100 free users, 10 paying customers, 10%+ conversion rate

### Feature Usage
**When to Use:** Feature validation
**How:** Track feature usage, link to conversion
**Metrics:** Feature adoption rate, conversion rate by feature usage
**Success Criteria:** 70%+ feature adoption, higher conversion for users

### A/B Tests
**When to Use:** Optimization, growth channel validation
**How:** Run A/B test, compare variants
**Metrics:** Conversion rate, engagement, revenue
**Success Criteria:** Statistically significant improvement

### Experiments
**When to Use:** Growth channel validation
**How:** Launch experiment, track results
**Metrics:** Signups, CAC, LTV, conversion rate
**Success Criteria:** Meets target metrics (e.g., 20% referral rate)

## Build-Measure-Learn Loop

### Build
**What:** Build feature, experiment, or test
**Output:** Feature/experiment/test ready to launch

### Measure
**What:** Collect data, track metrics
**Output:** Data and metrics collected

### Learn
**What:** Analyze results, identify learnings
**Output:** Learnings and insights

### Decide
**What:** Persevere or pivot based on learnings
**Output:** Decision and next steps

---

## Example: HYP-005 (Automated Reporting)

### Build
- **What:** Built automated report generation feature
- **Output:** Report generation feature implemented (`src/api/reports.py`)

### Measure
- **What:** Track feature usage, conversion linked to usage
- **Metrics:** Feature adoption rate, conversion rate by feature usage
- **Output:** [TBD - Need user data]

### Learn
- **What:** Analyze if automated reporting drives conversion
- **Learnings:** [TBD - Need data]
- **Output:** [TBD - Need learnings]

### Decide
- **What:** Persevere or pivot based on learnings
- **Decision:** [TBD - Need data]
- **Next Steps:** [TBD - Need decision]
