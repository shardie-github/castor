## Overview

This document traces our journey from initial idea to current state, showing evolution, learning, and progress.

---

## Phase 1: Discovery & Problem Validation (Months 1-2)

**Timeline:** [Start Date] - [End Date]

**What Happened:**
- Discovered problem: Podcasters can't prove ROI to sponsors
- Conducted initial research: User personas, market sizing
- Validated problem: User research framework, Jobs-to-Be-Done

**Key Learnings:**
- Problem is widespread (300K+ solo podcasters)
- Manual reporting takes 2+ hours per campaign
- Attribution is guesswork (promo codes unreliable)
- Sponsors don't trust data

**Key Decisions:**
- Focus on solo podcasters as beachhead (1K-50K downloads)
- Build unified platform (analytics + matching + attribution)
- Freemium model for low-friction acquisition

**Evidence:**
- User personas (`research/user-persona-matrix.md`)
- Market sizing (`yc/YC_MARKET_VISION.md`)
- Problem-solution fit (`yc/PROBLEM_SOLUTION_FIT.md`)

---

## Phase 2: MVP Development (Months 3-6)

**Timeline:** [Start Date] - [End Date]

**What Happened:**
- Built production-ready MVP
- Implemented core features (RSS ingestion, campaigns, attribution, reports)
- Built multi-tenant architecture
- Created comprehensive codebase

**Key Learnings:**
- Multi-tenant architecture is critical for agencies/networks
- Attribution requires multiple models for flexibility
- AI matching is feasible and differentiates us
- Freemium model reduces friction

**Key Decisions:**
- Multi-tenant architecture from day one (not retrofitted)
- Multiple attribution models (first-touch, last-touch, linear, time-decay, position-based)
- AI-powered matching engine
- Freemium model with usage-based conversion triggers

**Evidence:**
- Codebase: 200+ Python files, 70+ frontend files
- Architecture: `ARCHITECTURE.md`
- Features: `src/` (all core features implemented)

---

## Phase 3: Infrastructure & Strategy (Months 7-8)

**Timeline:** [Start Date] - [End Date]

**What Happened:**
- Built metrics infrastructure (event logging, aggregator, dashboard)
- Defined GTM strategy (distribution plan, growth experiments)
- Created pricing strategy (value-based pricing, conversion triggers)
- Documented comprehensive strategy

**Key Learnings:**
- Metrics infrastructure critical for growth
- Multiple growth channels needed (PLG, SEO, referrals, community)
- Pricing must align with value (time saved = $116-290/month)
- Experimentation framework needed for growth

**Key Decisions:**
- Build metrics infrastructure before launch
- Define GTM strategy with concrete experiments
- Value-based pricing aligned with WTP data
- Experimentation framework for growth

**Evidence:**
- Metrics: `src/analytics/user_metrics_aggregator.py`, `frontend/app/metrics/page.tsx`
- GTM Strategy: `yc/YC_DISTRIBUTION_PLAN.md`
- Pricing: `monetization/pricing-plan.md`
- Experiments: `yc/GROWTH_EXPERIMENTS.md`

---

## Phase 4: Pre-Launch Preparation (Months 9-10)

**Timeline:** [Start Date] - [End Date]

**What Happened:**
- Completed MVP with all core features
- Built comprehensive documentation
- Defined validation roadmap
- Prepared for launch

**Key Learnings:**
- Documentation critical for accelerator applications
- Validation framework needed before launch
- Multiple lens evaluation helps identify gaps
- Preparation reduces risk

**Key Decisions:**
- Complete comprehensive documentation
- Define validation roadmap
- Prepare for accelerator applications
- Build validation framework

**Evidence:**
- Documentation: `yc/` (comprehensive YC and accelerator docs)
- Validation: `yc/VALIDATION_EVIDENCE.md`
- Roadmap: `yc/TRACTION_NARRATIVE.md`
