## Churn Reduction

### Metrics to Track

**Monthly Metrics**:
- Churn rate (overall and by segment)

- Feature usage before churn
- Support interactions before churn

**Quarterly Goals**:
- Overall churn: < 5% monthly → < 3% monthly
- Time to churn: Increase average time to churn
- Churn by segment: Identify and reduce high-churn segments

### Churn Analysis

**Churn Segmentation**:
- By plan tier (Free, Starter, Professional, Enterprise)
- By usage level (low, medium, high)
- By feature adoption (low, medium, high)
- By support interactions (none, some, many)

**Churn Reasons** (from exit surveys):
- Too expensive
- Not enough value
- Missing features
- Too complex
- Found alternative
- No longer needed

### Optimization Areas

**Q1 Focus: Onboarding & Activation**

- [ ] Prioritize and build high-impact features
- [ ] Improve existing features based on feedback
- [ ] Add integrations requested by churned users

**Q4 Focus: Pricing & Packaging**
- [ ] Analyze pricing sensitivity
- [ ] Optimize plan tiers and limits
- [ ] Add usage-based pricing options
- [ ] Improve upgrade/downgrade experience

### Churn Prevention Tactics

**Early Warning System**:
