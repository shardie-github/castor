# YC Application Answers - Draft

**Draft answers to typical YC application questions**

**Based on:** [`yc/YC_PRODUCT_OVERVIEW.md`](../yc/YC_PRODUCT_OVERVIEW.md), [`yc/YC_MARKET_VISION.md`](../yc/YC_MARKET_VISION.md), and other YC docs

## What does your company do?

**Podcast Analytics & Sponsorship Platform** - We turn podcasts into revenue-generating machines by providing enterprise-grade analytics, automated sponsor matching, and attribution tracking that proves ROI to sponsors.

Podcasters are flying blind. They can't prove ROI to sponsors, so they leave money on the table. We built the infrastructure that tracks listener behavior, matches sponsors automatically, and measures campaign performance with real attribution—not guesswork.

---

## What is your company going to make?

A unified platform combining:
1. **Real-Time Analytics** - Track listener behavior, episode performance, demographics
2. **Intelligent Sponsor Matching** - AI-powered engine matches advertisers to podcasts
3. **Attribution That Proves ROI** - Multiple attribution models with cross-platform tracking
4. **Automated Campaign Management** - End-to-end automation from IOs to reports

**Result:** Generate sponsor reports in <30 seconds, prove ROI with real data, increase renewal rates 25%+.

---

## Why did you pick this idea to work on?

**The Problem:** Podcast monetization is broken. Most podcasters don't know who's listening, can't prove campaign ROI, and spend hours manually creating reports. Sponsors can't trust attribution data (promo codes are unreliable), so they underinvest in podcast advertising.

**Why This Problem:** We experienced this pain firsthand running podcast operations at scale. The tools don't exist, so we built them.

**Why Now:** Podcast industry maturing (2M+ podcasts), sponsorship market growing ($2B+), attribution tools improving, AI makes matching possible.

---

## What do you understand about your business that other companies in it just don't get?

1. **Attribution is the key** - Not just analytics, but proving ROI with real attribution data
2. **Multi-tenant from day one** - Agencies/networks need portfolio-level insights, not just single-podcast tools
3. **Automation is critical** - Podcasters spend 2+ hours on reports—automation is the value prop
4. **Cross-platform tracking** - Connecting podcast → website → purchase is the differentiator

---

## Who are your competitors, and who might become competitors? Who do you fear most?

**Competitors:**
- [FILL IN - List competitors]

**Why We're Different:**
- Only platform combining analytics + matching + attribution
- Cross-platform attribution that actually works
- AI-powered matching replaces manual discovery
- Multi-tenant built for agencies from day one

**Who We Fear Most:**
- [FILL IN - Biggest competitive threat]

---

## What's new about what you're making? What substitutes do people resort to because it doesn't exist yet (or they don't know about you)?

**What's New:**
- First platform to combine analytics, sponsor matching, and attribution in one system
- Cross-platform attribution that actually works (connects podcast → website → purchase)
- AI-powered matching that replaces manual cold-emailing
- Multi-tenant architecture built for agencies and networks from day one

**Substitutes:**
- Manual report creation (spreadsheets, Google Analytics)
- Multiple tools cobbled together (analytics + attribution + matching)
- Enterprise tools too expensive ($99+/month) for solo podcasters

---

## Who are your target customers?

**Beachhead:** Solo podcasters (1K-50K downloads) - ~300K podcasts globally

**Why This Segment:**
- Largest addressable market (~500K+ podcasters actively monetizing)
- Clear pain point (manual report creation, 2+ hours)
- Price-sensitive (can't afford enterprise tools, $99+/month)
- High growth potential (growing from 1K → 50K downloads = need better tools)

**Expansion:**
- Podcast networks (manage multiple shows)
- Agencies (onboard clients quickly)
- Brands/sponsors (ROI proof for podcast advertising)

---

## How do you know customers want what you're making?

**Validation:**
- [FILL IN - User interviews conducted]
- [FILL IN - Pain points validated]
- [FILL IN - Willingness to pay]

**Evidence:**
- Manual report creation is universal pain point (2+ hours)
- Attribution is guesswork (promo codes unreliable)
- No visibility into listener behavior
- Sponsors don't trust current attribution data

**See:** [`yc/USER_VALIDATION.md`](../yc/USER_VALIDATION.md) for detailed findings
