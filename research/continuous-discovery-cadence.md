## Insight-to-Backlog Mapping Process

### Step 1: Insight Capture

**Format:**
```
Insight ID: INS-2024-Q1-001
Date: 2024-01-15
Source: User Interview (User ID: U-12345, Persona: Solo Podcaster)
Insight: "Creating reports manually takes 2 hours. I'd pay extra for automated reports."
Pain Point: Manual report creation (P0.1)
Frequency: High (mentioned by 8/10 solo podcasters this quarter)
Impact: Critical (blocks core workflow)
```

### Step 2: Insight Validation

**Validation Criteria:**
- **Frequency:** Mentioned by 3+ users or 20%+ of survey respondents
- **Impact:** Blocks workflow or causes significant frustration
- **Evidence:** Multiple sources (interviews, surveys, support tickets)
- **Business Value:** Aligns with business goals and user needs

**Validation Methods:**
- Additional interviews (5-10 users)
- Survey questions
- Analytics validation (usage patterns)
- Support ticket analysis

### Step 3: Backlog Item Creation

**Format:**
```
Backlog Item ID: BLG-2024-001
Title: Automated Report Generation
Insight Source: INS-2024-Q1-001
Persona: Solo Podcaster (Primary), Producer, Agency
Pain Point: P0.1 - Manual Report Creation
Priority: P0 (Critical)
Effort: Large (8-12 weeks)
Value: High (addresses 85% of solo podcasters)
Success Criteria:
  - Report generation time: <5 minutes (vs. 2+ hours)
  - 90% of users generate reports within 24 hours of campaign end
  - 80%+ user satisfaction with feature
Validation Plan:
  - Beta test with 20 users
  - Measure time savings
  - Survey satisfaction
```

### Step 4: Backlog Prioritization

**Prioritization Factors:**
1. **Pain Point Severity:** Critical > High > Medium > Low
2. **User Frequency:** High frequency > Medium > Low
3. **Business Impact:** Revenue impact, retention impact, competitive advantage
4. **Effort:** Low effort, high value prioritized
5. **Strategic Alignment:** Aligns with product strategy and goals

**Prioritization Formula:**
```
Priority Score = (Pain Point Severity × 3) + (User Frequency × 2) + (Business Impact × 2) - (Effort × 1)
```

### Step 5: Validation Tracking

**Validation Status:**
- **Hypothesized:** Insight captured, not yet validated
- **Validating:** Currently validating with users
- **Validated:** Confirmed by multiple sources, ready to build
- **Invalidated:** Not confirmed, deprioritized
- **Built:** Feature built and released
- **Validated Post-Release:** Feature validated post-release

**Tracking:**
- Insight → Backlog Item → Feature → Release → Validation
