## Validation Framework

### Hypothesis Validation Status

**Status Definitions:**
- **Hypothesized:** Hypothesis created, not yet tested
- **Testing:** Currently in validation phase
- **Validated:** 80%+ of KPIs meet targets, hypothesis confirmed
- **Invalidated:** <50% of KPIs meet targets, hypothesis rejected
- **Needs Iteration:** 50-80% of KPIs meet targets, requires pivot
- **Built:** Feature built and released
- **Validated Post-Release:** Feature validated post-release with real users

### Validation Metrics Tracking

**Weekly Tracking:**
- Quantitative KPIs (automated dashboard)
- User feedback (support tickets, surveys)
- Feature usage analytics

**Monthly Review:**
- Hypothesis status update
- KPI progress vs. targets
- User interview insights
- Decision: Continue/Iterate/Invalidate

**Quarterly Review:**
- Comprehensive hypothesis portfolio review
- Success rate analysis
- Learnings and insights
- Roadmap adjustments

### Validation Success Criteria

**Hypothesis Validated:**
- 80%+ of quantitative KPIs meet targets
- 80%+ of qualitative feedback is positive
- User interviews confirm value
- Business metrics show improvement
- No critical issues or blockers

**Hypothesis Invalidated:**
- <50% of quantitative KPIs meet targets
- <50% of qualitative feedback is positive
- User interviews show lack of value
- Business metrics show no improvement
- Critical issues or blockers identified

**Hypothesis Needs Iteration:**
- 50-80% of quantitative KPIs meet targets
- Mixed qualitative feedback
- User interviews show partial value
- Business metrics show partial improvement
- Requires feature adjustments or pivot

### Risk Mitigation

**Validation Risks:**
1. **Sample Size Too Small:** Ensure minimum 20 beta users, 50+ A/B test users
2. **Biased Sample:** Recruit diverse user base across personas and usage patterns
3. **Measurement Errors:** Use multiple measurement methods, validate data quality
4. **External Factors:** Control for seasonality, market changes, competitive actions
5. **Premature Validation:** Wait full validation timeline before making decisions

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- Use statistical significance testing (p < 0.05)
- Multiple validation methods (quantitative + qualitative)
- Peer review of validation results
- External validation (user advisory board)
- Iterative validation (test → learn → iterate)
