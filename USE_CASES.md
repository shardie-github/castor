## Use Case 1: Solo Podcaster Proves Campaign ROI

**The Problem**: Sarah runs a tech podcast with 10,000 monthly listeners. A sponsor wants to know if their campaign drove actual conversions, but Sarah can't prove it. She's losing renewal opportunities and can't justify higher pricing.

**How This Solves It**: 
- Set up attribution tracking with unique promo codes and vanity URLs
- Track listener journey from podcast episode → website visit → purchase
- Generate automated reports showing attribution data (first-touch, last-touch, linear models)
- Demonstrate clear ROI with conversion data

**The Outcome**: Sarah renews the sponsor at 2x the original rate because she can prove the campaign drove $50K in revenue. She uses the same attribution data to attract three new sponsors.
